# Investigation of the mechanical properties of viruses in silico

This is a repository with the code of my bachelor's and master's theses at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology 
in Laboratory for Computer and Mathematical Modeling of Biological Systems "In silico investigation of the mechanical properties of DNA-containing capsids". 
You can find the full final text of my research as .
